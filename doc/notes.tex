    \section{General}

    \subsection{Constructs skipped during class editing}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Packages: \verb|javaassist.*|, \verb|icp.core|, \verb|sbt.|, \verb|org.testng.|,
        \verb|com.intelij.rt.|

        \item \verb|static| and \verb|abstract| methods are not instrumented.

        \item No permission checks on \verb|final| and \verb|static| fields.

        \item Permission field not added on: \verb|interfaces|, \verb|@External Annotation|
    \end{enumerate}


    \subsection{Calls to Lambdas are thread-safe}
    \lstinline{checkCall} permission checks are not inserted before lambdas. Therefor lambdas
    are thread-safe. The body of lambdas are edited; field writes and reads.

    \subsection{Synchronizers}
    Practices used when creating library synchronizers.

    \paragraph*{Final classes}
    All synchronizers should be \lstinline{final} or not extendable. For example,
    \lstinline{OneTimeLatchRegistration} has similar code in \lstinline{OneTimeLatch},
    but should not be a "is-a" relationship.

    \paragraph*{Registering methods}
    As task-based registration is becoming more relevant, code for registering multiple methods is
    repeated, and multiple Boolean TaskLocal's are used. There should be in the future a abstract
    class which handles method registration or use a single TaskLocal that keeps track of multiple
    method calls.

    \textcolor{blue}{TODO: A utility or common code for checking disjoint registrations is required.}

    \section{Ideas and Research}
    Features that are in consideration.

    \subsection{ICPCollections}
    Just how \verb|Collections.newXXX| static methods, there could be similar style for wrapping java.util
    maps, lists, and more. Other possibility is creating individual wrapper classes.

    \subsection{Use JavaAgent}
    JavaAgent's allow setting of custom class loader among other inspections. See
    https://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/how-to-inspect-classes-in-your-jvm/

    \subsection{Final Fields}
    Look into how JLS handles static vs non-static compiler inlines.
    See if a static call to \verb|getClass()| before
    access to final static field is made.

    \subsection{Replace Monitor locks with Reentrant instance locks}
    Without digging into the JVM, we cannot correctly check permissions for which a shared operation is accessed
    with a synchronized block or method.

    One possibility is replacing \verb|MonitorEnter| and \verb|MonitorExit| bytecode ops with lock() and unlock() methods
    of a reentrant lock. Depends on how Monitors are used.

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=java, caption=Synchornized Method]
    public synchronized void syncMethod() {
        shared++;
    }
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=JVMIS, caption=Bytecode for Listings 1]
public synchronized void syncMethod();
    Code:
        0: aload_0
        1: dup
        2: getfield      #2                  // Field shared:I
        5: iconst_1
        6: iadd
        7: putfield      #2                  // Field shared:I
        10: return
    \end{lstlisting}
     % @formatter:on

    In the cases of Listings 1 and 2, no bytecode ops for monitor enters and exists are used.
    Instead the JVM checks method for synchronized flag.

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
public void syncBlock() {
    synchronized(this) {
        shared++;
    }
}

      20: aload_1
      21: monitorexit
      22: aload_2
      23: athrow
      24: return

           4    16    19   any

    \end{lstlisting}
     % @formatter:on

    Explicit monitor enter and exit are used for synchronized blocks.

    One strategy for synchronized blocks is replacing a the enter and exit ops with a reentrant lock. Doing so gives
    ICP full control and allow the \gls{user} to use permissions associated with object monitors. The problem lies in how
    the system finds and replaces the bytecode.

    \subsubsection*{Possible solution 1}
    Since it may be difficult to know which object's monitor is used, inserting support functions before
    \lstinline{monitorenter} and after \lstinline{aload_0} (in these cases) may be able to get the object.
    Remove the monitor bytecode, insert reentrant lock and unlock on matching \lstinline{monitorexit}. Must use
    exception tables to always unlock lock.

    \paragraph*{Locking scenario}
    With monitor locks it is impossible\footnote{Possible through bytecode manipulation} to enter a monitor lock
    and exit in another method. Using the \gls{juc} Locks could allow one Task acquiring the lock, but having
    another task release it. This is only possible when the Thread runs two different tasks. This is avoided
    in \lstinline{SimpleReentrantLock} by setting Task owner.

    \subsubsection*{Possible solution 2}
    This was talked about on 10/30/17 and needs clarification, but instead of modifying the bytecode to replace
    monitors with ICP locks the \lstinline{Task.holdsLock()} could be used. This method can return false positives.
    \footnote{No notes why}.

    \section{Problems}

    \subsection{Use of @External Annotation}
    The External annotation is used to mark classes which should not have permission fields injected. Use cases may
    include external libraries\footnote{Right now there is no way to exclude entire or include specific packages},
    test classes and stateless static method classes.

    The problem arises when External classes are used in inheritance chains. Consider the following inheritance chain: \\
    \texttt{Object <- A <- B (External) <- C}

    Before moving on to scenarios, our class editing implementation\footnote{See PermissionSupport.addPermissionField()}
    for adding permission fields skips under these
    conditions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Class has \verb|@External| annotation
        \item Permission field exists in superclass
    \end{itemize}

    Whenever \texttt{ICP.setPermission(<object>, <permission>)} is called, a lookup for the permission field on
    \verb|<object>| is performed. That is done by the following:
    This algorithm returns the field closest up the inheritance chain and does not care if a class is @External.

    Finally, we have no control over how JavaAssist class loader loads classes. At any time, class A, B, or C
    can be loaded.

    \textcolor{blue}{TODO: Explain scenarios were @External annotations fail. Not that important right now.}

    \section{Synchronizers with Registrations}
    Registration refers to tasks saying \textit{I'm going to perform this operation} before calling it.
    For example, for the case of 1-time latches, a Task will inform the synchronizer it is an \textit{opener} before
    calling \lstinline{oneTimeLatch.open()}. This allows a disjoint set of opener and waiter tasks.

    As a side-effect of registration, Task-Based Permissions are possible. One-time latch permissions
    may include \textit{IsOpenPermission} and \textit{IsClosedPermission}. To use these permissions, three objects must
    be used: \textit{Data\footnote{Usually thread-safe}}, \textit{Accessor}, and \textit{Provider}. This makes coding
    awkward. See \nameref{sec:three-object-idiom} for more information.

    \subsection{Task-based permissions}
    The original intent of this project was to tie clear permissions to objects. Typically, only one invariant
    exists per Permission. \textit{IsOpen}, \textit{IsClosed}, \textit{HasLock} and so on.

    The downside is there can only be one permission for a single object. A simple workaround is having the \gls{user} create
    three classes: Underlying shared data, Accessor, and Provider. Then each object has a unique permission attached.
    For latches, \textit{IsOpen} goes to Accessor, and \textit{IsClosed} for Provider. This leaves the data object to
    be thread-safe in some cases.


    \subsubsection*{Failed Solution: Compound Permissions}
    To get around multiple permissions on a single object, a \textit{Compound} permission that uses
    composition of permissions. \lstinline{new JoinPermission(new ClosedPermission());}
    \footnote{A failed attempt of Task-Joining permission. Ideally, once a worker task joins, the master is able
    to see any shared objects the worker had (JMM). But, the worker task cannot acesses shared data after opening
    the latch while it is running.}
    Too complicated to implement and gets worse after composing more than one permission.

    \subsubsection*{Solution: Registration}
    By using Boolean TaskLocal's in the synchronizer, it is possible to have one permission \footnote{
    \textit{The Permission} to rule them all. For example, 1-time latch with registration has only
    one permission for both IsClosed and IsOpen checks.
    } tied to one object which has multiple invariants depending on the current task. The common strategy
    is:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Task tells synchronizer it will call an operation
        \item Task then calls operation
    \end{enumerate}

    Simple, but can be cumbersome for the \gls{user}:
    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}
// Worker task doing some work then calling countDown on CountDownLatch
// ... work
latch.countDowner(); // Worker says it's a countdowner
latch.countDown(); // Now worker may call countDown
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on

    The mistakes being caught are non-countdowners calling countdown operation; Master should not wait
    and call countdown. Though the example has the two methods right next to each other, it is usually
    writen as:

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(10); // ICP countdown latch of 10
SharedData data = new SharedData();
ICP.setPermission(data, latch.getPermission());

for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    new Thread(Task.newThreadSafeRunnable(() -> {
        // Worker registers as countdowner in first line of runnable (task)
        latch.countDowner();
        // ... more initialization

        // ... calculations

        data.set(i, <worker data>);
        latch.countDown(); // valid, worker is registered
    })).start();
}

latch.await();
// ... Access data
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on

    The goal is having the \gls{user} register their worker tasks immediately in task initialization. It would still be
    valid if \lstinline{latch.countDowner()} was called right before the count down.

    \section{Three Object Idiom} \label{sec:three-object-idiom}
    Permissions are tied at the Object level and not method.\footnote{Previous ICP revision did method level. (confirm???)}
    Take a simple Data object that uses a AtomicInteger as its underlying data. \textit{Provider} increments the integer,
    while \textit{Accessor} retrieves the count. Using a \lstinline{CountDownLatch}, the worker tasks who countdown
    are \textit{Providers}, and the master task who awaits is the \textit{Accessor}. Ideally, there should be permissions
    that allow the worker to only call \lstinline{increment} when the latch is closed, and assert the master can only
    access through \lstinline{retrieve} method once it is open. Unfortunality, this cannot work at the method level and the
    solution involves breaking the Data up into three parts:

    \begin{tikzpicture}
        \umlemptyclass[x=2]{Data}
        \umlemptyclass[y=-2]{Accessor}
        \umlemptyclass[x=4, y=-2]{Provider}

        \umlHVassoc[name=assoc, attr=data|1, pos=1.9]{Accessor}{Data}
        \umlHVassoc[name=assoc, attr=data|1, pos=1.9]{Provider}{Data}
    \end{tikzpicture}

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}
public class Data {
    final AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();

    public Data() {
        ICP.setPermission(this, Permissions.getPermanentlyThreadSafe());
    }

}

public class Accessor {
    final Data data;

    public Accessor(Data data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public int retrieve() {
        return data.count.get();
    }
}

public class Provider {
    final Data data;

    public Provider(Data data) {
        this.data = data;
    }

    public void increment() {
        this.data.count.incrementAndGet();
    }
}

// ... Somewhere after initialization and setting up synchronizer
ICP.setPermission(accessor, <permission-associated-with-master>);
ICP.setPermission(provider, <permission-associated-with-worker>);
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on

    The problem is \lstinline{Data} object is thread safe as both the accessor and provider need it.
    This is solved with task-based permission.

    \section{One-time latch}
    Count down latches of 1. \lstinline{isOpen()} opens latch, \lstinline{await()} waits for it to
    be open. Unlike ICP CountDownLatch, open may be called multiple times because in the case of multiple
    workers, only one should open the task, but any one may nondeterministically be the opener. This includes
    having multiple openers in registration. By using an AtomicInteger to keep track of remaining finishes tasks,
    it is possible to only call \lstinline{open} once, but all have to be registered to call open.

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Multiple openers, label=lst:multOpeners]
@Override
public void jobCompleted(WordResults job) {
    completeLatch.registerOpener(); // Any task may be an opener
    shared.addResult(job);
    int left = jobsLeft.decrementAndGet();
    if (left == 0) {
        // But only one task *opens* it
        completeLatch.open();
    }
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on

    With only one opener, Listings \ref{lst:multOpeners}
    \footnote{See \lstinline{applications.forkjoin.synchronizers.OneTimeLatchRegistration}}
    would be impossible.

    \subsection{Without registration}
    Only has \textit{IsOpen} permission associated with synchronizer. With now registration, is is possible
    for the worker task who called \lstinline{open()} to continue accessing the shared data.\footnote{IsOpen
    permission checks if latch is open, but does not know whether the current task is a worker or master.}
    See \lstinline{applications.latches.OneWorkerOneShared} for example.

    The disadvantage is the worker may still work on the shared object after calling \lstinline{open()}. This is
    fixed with the one-time latch using registration.

    \subsection{Registration}
    Similar to the non-registration latch, but tasks must explicitly tell the synchronizer they are either a
    \textit{opener} or \textit{waiter}. This is done by calling \lstinline{registerOpener()} and
    \lstinline{registerWaiter()} methods.

    With registration, the \textit{Three Object Idiom} can be replaced with a single Data Object and single
    permission \lstinline{getPermission()}. This permission first checks the current task and has multiple
    cases depending on opener or waiter.

    See \lstinline{applications.latches.OneWorkerOneRegistration} for example.

    \section{CountDownLatch}
    The General CountDownLatch synchronizer with a positive count and operation registration. There is no
    non-registration version because of the problems with 1-time latch (non-registration).\footnote{
    Just for fun, a non-registration CountDownLatch can be implemented, but only to prove registration fixes
    the problems that workers may still access after calling countdown.
    }

    Tasks must register as a \textit{CountDowner} or \textit{Waiter} using the methods \lstinline{registerCountDowner()}
    and \lstinline{registerWaiter()}. It is a violation if a \textit{CountDowner} calls \lstinline{countdown} more than
    once or the latch is open.

    See \lstinline{applications.latches.SimpleCountDown} for example.

    \input{sections/futures}

    \section{Joining Tasks}
    A common practice of fork-join implementations involves spawning multiple worker threads, join on all of them,
    and access the shared data. ICP works with Tasks, and not Threads which means the following code will not work:

    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}
// Fork
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    threads[i] = new Thread(() -> {
        data[i] = new Result(i);
    });
}

// Join
for(int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    threads[i].join();
    data[i].getResult(); // worker done with data
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on
    See \lstinline{applications.joins.Bad1} for complete example.

    There is a happens-before relationship of all the actions in each worker and then calling join() on same
    worker thread. However, no JMM checks are implemented in ICP so there needs to be a Join permission on result
    objects.

    This cannot be checked in the current system and the user must use permissions on objects that may be accessed
    after a given Task has joined\footnote{Better name is completed, finished, calling await()}. Every task has a
    \lstinline{join} and \lstinline{getJoinPermission} methods. Task-registration is used implicitly here as the
    current task running has permission access the object until the task has finished. The master task calls
    \lstinline{join} which registers itself.

    \paragraph*{Simple Example}
    % @formatter:off
    \begin{lstlisting}[caption=Example of Task.join()]
Task task = Task.ofThreadSafe(() -> {
  try {
    Thread.sleep(10);
  } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
  }

  data.counter = 1;
});
// set join permission on data
ICP.setPermission(data, task.getJoinPermission());

// throw away access to thread -- use task.join()
new Thread(task).start();

// join and get access to data
task.join();
assert data.counter == 1;
    \end{lstlisting}
    % @formatter:on

    \colortext{blue}{TODO: Mention failed TaskThread, TaskThreadGroup, and force setting of permissions which violates
    Hatcher's principle. Not used anymore.}

    \section{Semaphores}
    \paragraph*{Permissions} ~\\
    Each semaphore keeps a TaskLocal count of acquired permits for each task. The permission will assert
    that that task has acquired at least one permit.\footnote{Should at least N permits be a different
    permission or synchronizer?}.

    \subsection{Disjoint Semaphore}
    Semaphore were acquriers and releasers tasks are disjoint. A suitable scenario is a \lstinline{Bounded Buffer}.

    \subsection{Release Semaphore}
    Semaphore that requires the same Task who acquires N permits to release N permits.

    \paragraph*{Possible Implementation}
    How restrictive should \textit{the task who acquired N permits must release them} be?
    Once a calls \lstinline{acquire(N)} or \lstinline{acquire()} it must the same amount of
    N permits before calling another acquire.
